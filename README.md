 * 
 * Yellowtail (1998-2000) is an interactive software system for the gestural 
 * creation and performance of real-time abstract animation. Yellowtail repeats 
 * a user's strokes end-over-end, enabling simultaneous specification of a 
 * line's shape and quality of movement. Each line repeats according to its 
 * own period, producing an ever-changing and responsive display of lively, 
 * worm-like textures.
